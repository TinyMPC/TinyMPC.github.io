The TinyMPC solver is a numerical optimization package for solving convex quadratic model-predictive control programs in the default form

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
  \mbox{minimize} & \frac{1}{2} (x_N - \bar{x}_N)^T Q_f (x_N - \bar{x}_N) + \\
  & \sum_{k=0}^{N} \bigl( \frac{1}{2} (x_k - \bar{x}_k)^T Q (x_k - \bar{x}_k) + \frac{1}{2}(u_k - \bar{u}_k)^T R (u_k - \bar{u}_k) \bigr)\\
  \mbox{subject to} & x_{k+1} = A x_k + B u_k \\
                    & \overline u \le u_k \le \underline u \\
                    & \overline x \le x_k \le \underline x
\end{array}
$$

where $$x_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$$, $$u_k \in \mathbb{R}^m$$ are the state and control input at time step $$k$$, $$N$$ is the number of time steps (also referred to as the horizon), $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ and $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$$ define the system dynamics, $$Q \succeq 0$$, $$R \succ 0$$, and $$Q_f \succeq 0$$ are symmetric cost weight matrices and $$\bar{x}_k$$ and $$\bar{u}_k$$ are state and input reference trajectories.

## Features (Expected)

### Efficient

It uses a custom ADMM-based first-order method requiring no matrix factorization. All the other operations are extremely cheap. It also implements a Riccati recursion for primal update exploiting structures in the MPC problem.

### Robust

The algorithm is absolutely division free and it requires no assumptions on problem data (the problem only needs to be convex). It just works!

<!-- ### Detects primal / dual infeasible problems

When the problem is primal or dual infeasible, OSQP detects it. It is the first available QP solver based on first-order methods able to do so. -->

### Embeddable

It has an easy interface to generate customized embeddable C code with no memory manager required.

### Dependency-minimal

It only needs Eigen to run.

### Efficiently warm-started

It can be easily warm-started and the matrix factorization can be cached to solve parametrized problems extremely efficiently.

### Interfaces

It provides interfaces to C, C++, Julia, Matlab, Python.
